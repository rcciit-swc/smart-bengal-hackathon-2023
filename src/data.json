      "As Pesticides can contaminate our food, harm pollinators, and threaten our ecosystems. Beyond direct toxicity, pesticides can significantly reduce, change the behavior of, or destroy populations of plants and animals. These effects can ripple up and down food chains, causing what is known as a trophic.  Exposure and ingesting pesticides have been linked to causing many diseases such as hormone imbalances, cancer,asthma,headaches and inflammation due to the toxic load it adds to your body. Pesticides play a major role in the production of fruits and vegetables. Mainly pesticides are used to flourish the growth of fruits, but there is a level of safe consumption of pesticides. So that optimal solution is needed to detect and monitor the pesticides in the fruits and vegetables the common man is consuming. In order  to protect the human  against  these harmful effects of  pesticide , a Novel solution  is required to be developed  in order to detect and monitor the % level of pesticide  in fruits, vegetables  available in the market automatically .",

      "In modern society, it has become lot difficult to track potholes across a region for a governing authority. That’s why most of the time they remain unrepaired just because they are not tracked. Build a system that would track and identify potholes in a region and will geotag them and then will store the information in a centralised database. There will be an application which will use the database and display region-wise potholes info like where they are and how many of those are there in a particular region. Local government bodies can use these information for a better and smart governing process and those can be repaired sooner.The process of identifying a pothole can be done in different processes, some of them are mentioned below- 1) there can be a iot device (hardware + software) which will be installed in vehicles so whenever those vehicles goes through roads having potholes they will detect them and geotag them and send the information to the database. The identification may be done by Image Segmentation processes or Deep Learning techniques., 2) Drone imaging may be used for the same. Here also identification may be done by Image Segmentation or DL., 3) Community Project: There can be selected users for this project (public contributors) who can use an app made for this project to manually submit their local pothole information with location data of the potholes. These are merely ideas which the team can take as a headstart. They can use whatever method they want, even their own methods. Also there has to be another application which the governing authority will use when they have repaired a pothole, to remove the pothole information from the centralised database or to update the status of it.",

After flagging, the System should refer products and other medicines related to the disease to the user.",
      "The class timetabling problem is a typical scheduling problem that appears to be a stressful job in every academic institute. In previous years, timetable scheduling was done manually with a single person or group of individuals involved in the task of scheduling it manually. Planning of timetable is one of the most complex and error-prone applications because it is actually done manually. This situation demands a comprehensive approach where a computer can be used to schedule a timetabling problem by being automated using a concept. In institutions, the class time table is a major administrative activity which is prerequisite. The time table problem or conflict can be said to be the problem of assigning a number of events into a limited number of time period. The problem of the time table is subject to many constraints which are usually divided into two categories: “hard” and “soft”. Hard Constraints: These are constraints that must be enforced. Some examples of such constraints are: 1. In each period, there should be sufficient resources (e.g. rooms and lecturers) available for all the events that have been scheduled for that time period. 2. No lecturer should have different classes at the same time slot. There cannot be more than two classes for a subject in one day. Soft Constraints: Soft constraints are those that are desirable but not absolutely essential. Sometimes it is impossible to satisfy all soft constraints in real world situations. Some of the soft constraints (in both exams and course timetabling) are: 3. Lecturers and students may prefer to have all their lectures in some number of days and to have a number of lecture-free days 4. Lab classes may not be in consecutive hours 5. Every staff should get at least one first hour 6. A particular class may need to be scheduled in a particular time period. Objectives The project is a software application that many Institutions, businesses and some companies may actually need. This is a simple case of an allocation problem. (1) The project involves developing a program that can schedule time table effectively for school. The prototype of this work should be followed by the development of a booking system that can automatically allocate resources. (2) The main principal of this project is to solve timetable problems with evolutionary computing processes."
